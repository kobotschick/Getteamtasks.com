			<h2>a task list and then some</h2>
			<p>
				Teamtasks is a simple task list. It lets you keep track of those things that you would only go and forget. Hey, no judgement. It happens! Since we all like to work differently, teamtasks is designed to be simple, but easy to customize and extend so that it fits your way of working. 
			</p>
			<h2>a personal wiki</h2>
			<p>
				Teamtasks is based on <a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.com' title='tiddlywiki.com'>TiddlyWiki</a>, the popular single paged wiki.  That means that you can keep your notes and other wiki delights right along with your tasks. There is nothing to install, so nothing for the IT department at work to get in a tizzy about. Just a single web page.
			</p>
			<h2>it goes with you</h2>
			<p>
				One of the benefits of being based on <a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.com' title='tiddlywiki.com'>TiddlyWiki</a> is that you can take teamtasks with you anywhere. Keep it on a USB stick, a webserver, your hard-drive, or your latest shiny little pocket gizmo. As long as you have access to a modern web browser and your teamtasks file, you should be in clover.
			</p>
			<h2>share and enjoy</h2>
			<p>
				Some jobs are too big for one person to manage on their own. Even you. Thanks to the hard work of others, teamtasks can also be hosted on a webserver up in the cloud so that you can share tasks with others. You'll be able to deploy teamtasks for sharing using <a href='http://www.tiddlyspot.com' title='tiddlyspot.com'>TiddlySpot</a>, <a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/TiddlyWeb' title='TiddlyWeb'>TiddlyWeb</a>, <a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/CcTiddly' title='ccTiddly'>ccTiddly</a> or somewhere of your own if have the urge.

				<p>Teamtasks was the squawking brainchild of <a href='http://hawksworx.com' rel='me' title='Phil Hawksworth'>Phil Hawksworth</a> and is now being lovingly tinkered with and developed by the nice chaps at <a href='http://www.osmosoft.com'>Osmosoft</a>.</p>
				<p>Hold on to your hats though because there are other task management tools based on <a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.com' title='tiddlywiki.com'>TiddlyWiki</a> out there already.  If this one isn't quite your cup of tea, perhaps consider trying the simple and elegant <a href='http://nathanbowers.com/gtdtw/' title='GTDTiddlyWiki'>GTDTiddlyWiki</a>, the 'kinkless' approach at <a href='http://dcubed.ca/' title='dcubed.ca'>d cubed</a>, or the more powerful <a href='http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/' title='MonkeyGTD'>MonkeyGTD</a></p>
